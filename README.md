# library_management
This is a program for managing libraries by implementing CRUD. This program uses the C++ language.
To use it, download all the files in the library_management repository or you can clone this repository. This program saves the data that we input into the txt file. For the data_akun.txt file, it stores account data used to borrow books. For data_books.txt it stores the book data that we added in the program. And the last one is data_pinjam.txt which stores book borrower data.
